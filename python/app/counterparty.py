"""Counterparty verification: checks the tender's issuing client/authority
against OpenSanctions' aggregated global sanctions, debarment, and PEP
watchlists - which include multilateral development bank debarred-firms
lists (World Bank, ADB, ...) relevant to internationally financed EPC
tenders - so the accounting agent can flag a barred or sanctioned
counterparty instead of taking the document's own description of the client
at face value.

Deterministic, no LLM involved - same shape as app/company_context.py's
get_context_for_category, wrapped as a tool in agents/tools.py. Results are
cached in Postgres (see app/db.py) since watchlist data changes slowly and a
given client/authority is often the counterparty on many bids.
