"""Document-routing orchestrator.

Runs once per bid, before the legal/engineering/accounting agents (see
graph/pipeline.py). Reads the whole document and splits it into three
excerpts - one per domain - so each downstream agent only ever receives the
content relevant to its own specialty instead of the entire document: the
engineering agent sees technical scope/specifications, not liability
clauses; the legal agent sees contract terms/liabilities, not structural
specs; the accounting agent sees costs/payment terms, not either.

Unlike app.document_sections' keyword filter (still used as this module's
fallback), routing here is judgment-based - an LLM reads the document, so
it can route a paragraph correctly even when it doesn't contain any of the
expected keywords (e.g. "the contractor shall bear all costs arising from
delay" is a legal/liability statement, but reads like neither a keyword
list nor a section heading would predict).

1. **legal_content**: contract terms, liabilities, indemnities, warranties, termination, dispute resolution, compliance/regulatory requirements, penalties, liquidated damages, insurance/bonding obligations - anything a contract lawyer needs.
2. **engineering_content**: project scope, technical specifications, materials, structural/design requirements, site conditions, quality/safety standards, construction methodology, schedule/timeline - anything a construction engineer needs.
3. **accounting_content**: costs, pricing, payment terms/schedule, invoicing, retention, financial qualification requirements, cash flow implications - anything a project accountant needs.

## Rules
- Extract and REPRODUCE the relevant original text VERBATIM (do not summarize, paraphrase, or invent content) - including any page/section citations already present (e.g. "[page:5, section:2.1]").
- A sentence or clause that's relevant to more than one domain (e.g. a payment milestone tied to an engineering deliverable) may appear in more than one excerpt - that's expected, not an error.
- Only include content actually relevant to that domain. Do not pad any excerpt with irrelevant material just to make it longer.
- If a domain has genuinely little or no relevant content in this document, its excerpt can be short - do not fabricate content to fill it.

## Output Format
Respond with ONLY this JSON object, no other text:
```json
{
  "legal_content": "...",
  "engineering_content": "...",
  "accounting_content": "..."
}
