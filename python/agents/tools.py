"""
Reusable document-extraction tool.

Text extraction from a PDF is a deterministic, mechanical operation - it
should never be something an LLM agent "does" by reading raw bytes or
guessing at content. This module wraps the deterministic extractor
(`app.pdf_extract`) as a single LangChain tool, `extract_document_text`,
that every agent shares: the agent calls the tool, the tool returns exactly
what `pypdf` extracted, and the agent reasons over that - it never parses
the PDF itself.

A small on-disk `DocumentStore` sits in front of it so agents can refer to
an uploaded document by a short `document_id` instead of the tool call
needing to carry the full file bytes as an argument.
